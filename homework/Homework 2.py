# Overflow. What would happen if you went beyond the range for a particular type? For example, the largest integer that can be stored in int8 is 127, and the smallest integer is -128, so what would happen if we type cast a larger integer to the type int8? Smaller integer? Use the MATLAB built-in functions intmin and intmax or Pythonâ€™s numpy package command iinfo to find the largest and smallest integers that can be stored in int16 and int32.
